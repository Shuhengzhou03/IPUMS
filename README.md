# State-Level Respondent Analysis Using Ratio Estimators

## Overview
This project explores the use of ratio estimators to analyze respondent counts across U.S. states using the 2022 ACS PUMS dataset. California is used as the reference state to estimate the total population of respondents in other states based on the ratio of doctoral degree holders to the total population. The analysis includes code and results comparing these estimates to the actual respondent counts.

## Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
- **Paper/**:
  - **IPUMS_2022.pdf**: The compiled report summarizing the analysis, methodology, and results.
  - **IPUMS_2022.qmd**: The Quarto file containing all code, analysis, and visualizations.
  - **references.bib**: A BibTeX file managing citations used in the project.
- **llm_usage/**:
  - **usage.txt**: Documentation on the use of language models (LLMs) in this project.
- **IPUMS_2022.Rproj**: RStudio project file for easy navigation.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview, structure, and LLM usage.

## LLM Usage
This project utilized **ChatGPT-4** for:
- Writing and refining the README file.
- Providing guidance on structuring the Quarto document.
- Enhancing the clarity of methodology descriptions and visualizations.
